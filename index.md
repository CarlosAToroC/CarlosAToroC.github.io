I am currently a PhD student at [IMPA](https://impa.br/) (Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada) under the supervision of professor [Lucas Ambrozio](https://w3.impa.br/~l.ambrozio/).

My research area is differential geometry with particular interest in the theory of free boundary minimal surfaces.
